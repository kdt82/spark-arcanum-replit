# Spark Arcanum - Magic: The Gathering Rules & Deck Builder

## Overview

Spark Arcanum is a comprehensive Magic: The Gathering platform that combines AI-powered rules interpretation with advanced deck building tools. The application provides intelligent card search, rules analysis, and deck management capabilities for MTG players, featuring a database of over 114,000 cards and sophisticated AI-driven rule explanations.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety and modern component patterns
- **Vite** as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
- **TanStack Query** for efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS** with **shadcn/ui** components for consistent design system
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach and dark/light theme support

### Backend Architecture
- **Node.js** with **Express** server providing RESTful API endpoints
- **TypeScript** throughout the entire stack for consistency and type safety
- **Modular route organization** with separate auth, deck, GraphQL, and SEO route handlers
- **Middleware-based architecture** for authentication, error handling, and request processing

### Database Layer
- **PostgreSQL** database with **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations
- **Neon Database** serverless hosting for scalable database management
- **MTGSQLive integration** - Uses MTGSQLive PostgreSQL schema exclusively (NO AllPrintings.json files)
- **Schema-first design** with shared type definitions between client and server

### CRITICAL RULE: MTGSQLive PostgreSQL Schema ONLY  
- **NEVER use AllPrintings.json files** - System designed for official MTGJSON PostgreSQL import exclusively
- **MTGSQLive approach** requires psql command-line tool to import https://mtgjson.com/api/v5/AllPrintings.psql
- **Railway limitation** - MTGSQLive import not supported on Railway due to missing psql/xz dependencies
- **Database philosophy** - Authentic MTGJSON PostgreSQL schema only, no JSON file processing allowed

## Key Components

### AI-Powered Rules Engine
- **OpenAI GPT-4o integration** for sophisticated rule interpretation
- **Context-aware analysis** that considers card interactions, timing, and game state
- **Comprehensive rules database** imported from official MTG sources
- **Multi-modal search** supporting both semantic and keyword-based queries

### Card Database System
- **MTGJSON integration** for authoritative card data from all MTG sets
- **GraphQL API** integration for real-time card information
- **Intelligent search** with exact match prioritization and fuzzy matching
- **Rarity repair service** to maintain data integrity across card printings

### Deck Building Platform
- **Format validation** for Standard, Modern, Legacy, Commander, and other formats
- **Import/export functionality** supporting standard deck list formats
- **Public deck sharing** with privacy controls and community features
- **Real-time statistics** including mana curve analysis and color distribution

### User Management
- **Secure authentication** with bcrypt password hashing and session tokens
- **Password reset** functionality via email integration
- **GDPR compliance** with cookie consent and privacy controls
- **Role-based access** with admin panel for system management

## Data Flow

### Card Search and Retrieval
1. User queries are processed through multiple search endpoints
2. Local database search provides fast results for common queries
3. GraphQL API fallback ensures comprehensive card coverage
4. Results are cached and prioritized by relevance and exact matches

### AI Rules Analysis
1. User submits rule questions with optional card context
2. System augments query with relevant card text and rules references
3. OpenAI processes request with comprehensive MTG rules context
4. Response includes detailed analysis with rule number citations

### Deck Management
1. Authenticated users can create and manage personal deck collections
2. Deck validation ensures format compliance and card legality
3. Public decks are indexed for community browsing and SEO
4. Import/export functionality supports various deck list formats
