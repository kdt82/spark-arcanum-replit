## Step 1: Push to GitHub

### Current Situation
You are on the `clean-main` branch which contains the clean codebase (76MB) without database files. The `main` branch on GitHub still contains large files that prevent normal pushing.

### SOLUTION: Force Push Clean Branch

Since git authentication requires your credentials, run these commands in the Replit Shell:

```bash
# Check current branch (should show: * clean-main)
git branch

# Check status (should show: clean working tree)
git status

# FORCE PUSH: Replace problematic main branch with clean branch
git push --force-with-lease origin clean-main:main

# If the above fails, use stronger force push:
git push --force origin clean-main:main
```

### Why Force Push is Necessary
- Your `clean-main` branch has completely different history than remote `main`
- Remote `main` contains 563MB+ database files that prevent deployment
- Force push replaces the entire remote history with your clean branch
- Results in deployable 76MB repository without large files

### Alternative: Standard Git Workflow (if force push fails)
```bash
# Only use if force push doesn't work
git rm --cached -r data/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Data directory removed from tracking"
git rm --cached data/AllPrintings.psql 2>/dev/null || echo "PostgreSQL file removed from tracking"
git rm --cached data/AllPrintings.psql.xz 2>/dev/null || echo "Compressed file removed from tracking"
git rm --cached data/AllPrintings.json 2>/dev/null || echo "JSON file removed from tracking"

git add .
git commit -m "Remove large database files from tracking - prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

## Step 2: Deploy to Railway

### Quick Deploy (Recommended)
1. **Go to**: https://railway.app
2. **Click**: "New Project" 
3. **Select**: "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. **Choose**: Your repository (`spark-arcanum` or similar)
5. **Click**: "Deploy Now"

Railway will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Detect Node.js project and use `nixpacks.toml` configuration
- ‚úÖ Install dependencies with `npm ci`
- ‚úÖ Build with `npm run build`
- ‚úÖ Start with `node dist/index.js`
- ‚úÖ Set up health checks at `/api/health`
- ‚úÖ Create fresh PostgreSQL database (no local data transferred)
- ‚úÖ Download and import MTGJSON v5.2.2 on first startup

## ‚úÖ .gitignore Fixes Applied

**Before Fix:** ~538MB (including database files)
**After Fix:** ~76MB (codebase only)

**Now Excluded from GitHub Push:**
- `data/` directory (538MB of MTGJSON files)
- `uploads/` directory (user content)
- `temp/` and `cache/` directories
- All `*.psql`, `*.json`, and `*.xz` database files
- Large attached assets and temporary files

**Railway Benefits:**
- Faster GitHub push (76MB vs 538MB)
- Fresh database created on each deployment
- No data contamination between environments
- Official MTGJSON import on Railway startup

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables (CRITICAL - App won't work without these)

In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Variables tab, add these **required** variables:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-64-character-session-key-here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

**IMPORTANT: Your app is currently deployed but missing these variables, causing authentication and AI features to fail.**

**Generate a secure SESSION_SECRET:**
```bash
# Run this in any terminal to generate a secure key
openssl rand -base64 64
# Example output: bSIbVUnQIugnagz8p9EGPRglyqeT0fcy9gAl9XeTKAVEokdEjbAiqpiRhqLqePy6zeIKlc+37LjbpWVEgJn5Pg==
```

**Get your OPENAI_API_KEY:**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key starting with `sk-`

**After adding variables in Railway:**
1. Click "Redeploy" to restart with new environment variables
2. Monitor logs for successful startup

### Step 4: Add PostgreSQL Database (Recommended)

1. **In Railway project**: Click "New Service"
2. **Select**: "PostgreSQL"
3. **Railway automatically**:
   - Creates `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
   - Connects it to your application
   - The app will auto-create all required tables

### Step 5: Monitor Deployment

Watch Railway logs for successful startup:

```
üöÇ Railway Environment Variable Loader
üìã Railway Platform Detected: true
‚úÖ NODE_ENV: Set (10 chars)
‚úÖ SESSION_SECRET: Set (64 chars)
‚úÖ DATABASE_URL: Set (railway postgresql)
üöÄ Starting Spark Arcanum server...
üéØ Spark Arcanum serving on port 8080
üìö Database schema verified - initializing rules service
‚úÖ All 6 core tables created successfully
üéâ Magic: The Gathering database ready (115,000+ cards)
```

## Step 6: Access Your Application

Railway provides a URL like:
**https://your-app-name.railway.app**

## Features Available After Deployment

### With Database (PostgreSQL service added):
- ‚úÖ **Complete MTG Database**: 115,000+ cards with full MTGJSON data
- ‚úÖ **User Authentication**: Sign up, login, password reset
- ‚úÖ **Deck Builder**: Create, save, and share decks
- ‚úÖ **AI Rules Expert**: OpenAI-powered Magic rules assistance
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Search**: Filter by sets, types, colors, mechanics
- ‚úÖ **Public Deck Gallery**: Browse community decks

### Basic Mode (No database):
- ‚úÖ **Card Search**: Basic card lookup functionality
- ‚úÖ **Rules Reference**: Static MTG rules access
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited Features**: No deck saving or user accounts

## Troubleshooting Railway Deployment

### Environment Variable Issues
If variables show "NOT SET" in logs (like your current deployment):

1. **Add missing variables** in Railway dashboard ‚Üí Variables tab
2. **Required variables**: `SESSION_SECRET` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` 
3. **Force redeploy**: Railway ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí "Redeploy"
4. **Check logs**: Look for "Railway Environment Variable Loader" output showing all variables as "‚úÖ Set"

**Current Status**: Your app deployed successfully but had database schema issues. The rules table "chapter" column error has been fixed and should work on next redeploy.

### Database Connection Issues
If database fails to connect:

1. **Verify PostgreSQL service** is added to your Railway project
2. **Check DATABASE_URL**: Should start with `postgresql://`
3. **Manual initialization**: Visit `/api/admin/init-database` in browser

### Health Check Failures
If Railway shows service as unhealthy:

1. **Check health endpoint**: Visit `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`
2. **Review startup logs**: Look for server startup confirmation
3. **Verify port binding**: App should bind to Railway's PORT variable

## Advanced Railway Configuration

The app includes production-ready configuration:

- **`railway.toml`**: Railway deployment settings with health checks
- **`nixpacks.toml`**: Build configuration optimized for Node.js
- **`Dockerfile`**: Container configuration (backup deployment method)
- **`Procfile`**: Process definitions (backup for Railway)

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test all features**: Browse to your Railway URL and test functionality
2. **Add custom domain** (optional): Railway ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
3. **Monitor performance**: Railway ‚Üí Metrics tab
4. **Enable auto-deploys**: Automatically deploy when you push to GitHub

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. **Check Railway logs**: Most deployment issues show up in build/runtime logs
2. **Verify environment variables**: All required variables must be set
3. **Test health endpoint**: `/api/health` should return database connection status

Your Magic: The Gathering deck builder is now live with complete MTGJSON database support and all production features enabled! üéâ
