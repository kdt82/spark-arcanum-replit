# Railway Configuration Fix - Root Cause Found

## The Real Problem
The issue was in our Railway configuration files that were **overriding** the dashboard environment variables:

### 1. railway.toml had:
```toml
[environments.production]
variables = {}  # This EMPTY object was overriding dashboard variables!
```

### 2. nixpacks.toml had:
```toml
[variables]
NODE_ENV = 'production'  # This was potentially conflicting
```

## Fix Applied
- **Removed empty variables object** from railway.toml
- **Removed hardcoded variables** from nixpacks.toml
- **Let Railway inject variables** from dashboard only

## Root Cause
Railway configuration files with empty or conflicting variable definitions can override the dashboard variables, preventing them from being injected into the Node.js process.

## Push This Critical Fix

**Run in Replit Shell:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "CRITICAL: Fix Railway config overriding dashboard environment variables"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Result After Fix
Railway logs should now show:
```
üîç IMMEDIATE Environment Check (Raw Process):
   DATABASE_URL: EXISTS (111 chars)
   SESSION_SECRET: EXISTS (32 chars)
   OPENAI_API_KEY: EXISTS (164 chars)
```

## Why This Was Happening
- Railway reads configuration files FIRST
- Then applies dashboard variables
- But our config files had empty/conflicting variable sections
- This prevented dashboard injection

This should resolve the environment variable issue completely.
